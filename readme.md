You have to defined the software architecture and explain the reasons why you would select it

## What We Care About

Use any libraries that you would normally use if this were a real production App. Please note: we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library or feature.

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

Here's what you should strive for:

- Software architecture diagram
- Good use of the backend stack selected
- API design best practices.
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.


## Functionality
1. Write the HTTP endpoints needed to follow the information flow specified.
2. Write the HTTP endpoints to get and filter orders by id, user, date, and page (pagination)
3. Provide proper unit tests.

## Basic Requirements

1. Use Springboot (Java or Kotlin), NodeJs (Express, Loopback or Hapi framework), Go or DotNetCore Framework (C#).
2. Use any persistence store, explain your selection.
3. Write concise and clear commit messages.
4. Draw the Software architecture diagram
5. Write clear documentation on how it has been designed and how to run the code.

## Bonus

- Write a API Gateway to monitor the status of services and be able to notify by the event bus in kafka or any other streaming platform that you have used for the communication between microservices, what service is failing.
- Providing an online demo is welcomed, but not required.

## Good luck!

We look forward to seeing what you can do. Remember, although it is a test, there are no specific right or wrong answers that we are looking for - just do the job as best you can.
